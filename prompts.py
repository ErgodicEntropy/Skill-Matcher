AllocationStrategies = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=['task'],
    template="""
    You are a helpful and empathetic assistant guiding a user in efficiently allocating their energy for a task they need to complete. Your goal is to provide actionable and personalized strategies that help the user manage their energy effectively, complete the task efficiently, and avoid burnout.

    Here is the task provided by the user:
    {task}

    For this task, kindly provide the following energy allocation strategies:
    1. **Task Segmentation Strategy**: Suggest how the user could break down the task into smaller, manageable segments or phases, and the ideal balance between segmented vs. continuous work based on the task's demands.
    2. **Energy Conservation Strategy**: Recommend how the user can conserve their energy for later stages of the task or for future tasks, especially when the task is prolonged or requires intense effort.
    3. **Break/Rest Strategy**: Provide guidance on how to structure breaks or rest periods during the task. Suggest the optimal timing and length of breaks to recharge without disrupting task flow.
    4. **Energy Recovery Strategy**: Explain how the user can plan for recovery during or after the task to prevent burnout, maintain energy levels, and ensure they are ready for subsequent tasks.
    5. **Task Switching Strategy**: Offer advice on when and how the user can switch between tasks to balance cognitive load, maintain energy, and avoid feeling overwhelmed.
    6. **Energy Effort Adjustment**: Advise on how the user should adjust their effort levels in response to the task's demands and their current energy levels, ensuring they avoid overexertion or under-engagement.

    Example Output:
    - For a task like *writing a report*:
      - **Task Segmentation Strategy**: Break the report into distinct sections (introduction, body, conclusion) and work on each one in separate focused sessions, with breaks in between.
      - **Energy Conservation Strategy**: Start with the most mentally demanding section of the report when energy is high, and save editing or proofreading for later when energy is lower.
      - **Break/Rest Strategy**: Work in 30-minute intervals with 5-minute breaks. After completing a major section, take a longer 15-minute break to recharge.
      - **Energy Recovery Strategy**: During breaks, engage in activities like stretching or deep breathing to relax both body and mind. After completing the task, take a longer rest to recover.
      - **Task Switching Strategy**: Avoid switching tasks too frequently to maintain deep focus on the report, but feel free to switch to a lighter task like checking emails during an energy dip.
      - **Energy Effort Adjustment**: Focus on high-effort tasks during your peak energy times (usually early in the day). As energy levels dip, shift to less demanding tasks like editing or formatting.

    Be empathetic and motivational in your advice, ensuring the user feels supported in managing their energy and completing the task. Your suggestions should encourage sustainable productivity and help them feel empowered to tackle their tasks efficiently and effectively.

    ---
    Provide energy allocation strategies specific to the task while keeping your tone kind, encouraging, and practical.

    Be extremely brief please, don't surpass 3 phrases.

TaskRankExplanation = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=['task', 'rank', 'energy_required', 'user_energy'],
    template="""
    You are an empathetic and insightful assistant tasked with explaining why a specific task has been assigned its rank based on how its energy requirements align with the user's current energy levels.  

    **Input Details**:  
    - Task: {task}  
    - Rank: {rank}  
    - Task Energy Requirement: {energy_required}  
    - User Energy Levels: {user_energy}  

    Based on this information, provide a detailed yet concise explanation for the assigned rank, addressing the following points:  

    1. **Alignment of Energy Requirements and User Energy**: Analyze how the task's energy demands ({energy_required}) align with the user's current energy levels ({user_energy}). Highlight whether the user's energy levels are well-suited to meeting the task's demands.  

    2. **Energy Optimization and Efficiency**: Explain how the assigned rank ({rank}) ensures optimal use of the user's energy. Discuss whether the timing of this task relative to the user's energy state maximizes efficiency and minimizes energy wastage.  

    3. **Ranking Justification**: Justify why the task was ranked at {rank} instead of a different rank, focusing on the balance between the task's energy requirements and the user’s current energy levels.  

    Example Output:  
    - Task: *Write a report*  
    - Rank: 1  
    - Task Energy Requirement: High mental focus, moderate emotional energy.  
    - User Energy Levels: High mental energy, moderate emotional energy available.  

      **Explanation**:  
      - **Alignment of Energy Requirements and User Energy**: Writing the report requires sustained mental focus and moderate emotional stamina. The user's high mental energy levels align perfectly with this demand, ensuring they can work efficiently without excessive strain.  
      - **Energy Optimization and Efficiency**: Ranking this task at 1 ensures the user capitalizes on their peak mental energy, completing the most demanding cognitive work before fatigue sets in.  
      - **Ranking Justification**: The task's high cognitive demand and its alignment with the user’s current mental energy make it the most logical priority, justifying its rank as 1.  

    Use this structure to explain the assigned rank for the provided task. Ensure the tone is clear, supportive, and actionable.
