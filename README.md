### Logical Architecture
![Logical Architecture](diagrams/Logical%20Architecture.jpeg)
#### Components Analysis

- **System Inputs**
   - **Role**: The data provided by the user that the AI uses to make decisions. Includes:
     - **Experience**: User’s background, CV, or paragraph describing their expertise.
     - **Task Novelty**: The level of unfamiliarity or learning required for each task.
     - **Task List**: The list of tasks or goals the user wants to accomplish.

- **AI Intervention**
   - **Role**: The core AI system that processes user inputs, analyzes data, and generates recommendations. It acts as the brain of the app, ensuring tasks are aligned with skills and experience.

- **Skill Transferability**
   - **Role**: A metric calculated by the AI to determine how well the user’s existing skills can be applied to a specific task. Higher transferability means the task is a better fit for the user’s current abilities.

- **Task Novelty**
   - **Role**: A metric that evaluates how new or challenging a task is for the user. Tasks with high novelty may require more learning or adaptation.


- **User Feedback on Finished Tasks**
   - **Role**: Input from the user on the AI’s recommendations. This feedback is used to refine the reinforcement learning model and improve future suggestions.

- **Task Requirements**  
   - **Role**: A database that stores the **required skills** for each task and the **level of importance (weight)** of each skill for that task (stores skill-task mappings and skill weights for each task). This database is dynamically updated and enriched with each user’s feedback on finished tasks, enabling the system to refine task requirements over time. It also enables **network effects** by aggregating feedback from multiple users to improve task requirements globally.  

- **Network Effects**
   - **Role**: A potential future feature where user interactions and feedback contribute to a shared knowledge base, improving recommendations for all users over time.

- **Optimal Tasks**
   - **Role**: The final list of tasks recommended by the AI after analyzing skill transferability, task novelty, and user preferences.

- **Kanban Board**
   - **Role**: A visual tool for organizing and managing tasks. It allows users to drag and drop tasks into categories like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."

- **AI Intervention**: 
    - **Rank Explanation**  
        - **Role**: Provides clear and actionable reasoning behind the AI’s task rankings. This helps users understand why certain tasks are recommended over others, based on skill transferability, task novelty, and alignment with their goals.  

    - **Recommendation**  
        - **Role**: The AI-generated suggestions for tasks that align with the user’s skills and experience. These recommendations are ranked by priority (urgency/importance) and alignment (skill-task fit), ensuring users focus on the most relevant and achievable tasks.  

- **Reinforcement Learning Model (RLHF)**  
   - **Role**: A machine learning model that improves over time based on **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**. It refines task recommendations and skill-task alignment by learning from user interactions, feedback on task completion, and system performance.  

- **Rewards System**  
   - **Role**: A gamified feature that incentivizes users to complete tasks by offering rewards (e.g., badges, points, or progress tracking). It motivates users to stay engaged and provides positive reinforcement for achieving their goals.
